WEBVTT

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.390
Whoa! It's raining cats
and dogs out there!

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.119
I hope they make it back
all right.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.350
Heads up! Andy's coming!

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.039
Andy, time for dinner.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.519
Yes! I'm starving!

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.656
Don't forget
to wash your hands!

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.680
Okay, Mom!

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.559
- Do you see him?
- No.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.909
Well, he's done for.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.149
He'll be lost! Forever!

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.992
Jessie. Buzz. Slink.
Molly's room.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.276
The rest of you, stay put.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.640
Bo!

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.920
Situation?

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.993
Lost toy. Side yard.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.355
Billy. Goat. Gruff.
Raise the blinds.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.440
They have names?
You never told me that.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
You never asked.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480
Where is he?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.155
There!

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.280
How do we reach him?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.753
Operation Pull-Toy!

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.353
- Slink!
- You got it, Woody!

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.993
Barbies!

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.640
Go!

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.955
Flashlight.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.108
Hang on, R.C.!

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.034
I ain't got any more slink!

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.874
Oh, it's beautiful.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.016
I'm so glad to see

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.439
this old lamp
go to a good home.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.079
We've had it since
Molly was a baby.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.999
Molly, are you sure
it's all right?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.496
Yeah,
I don't want it anymore.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.873
Thank you.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.909
Where's Woody?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.311
Yeah, hi.
I think I left my keys here.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.115
- Woody.
- Quick!

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.880
We'll sneak in the hedges
before he's back.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.871
Woody, it's okay.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.110
What? No! No, no, no.
You can't go!

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.376
What's best for Andy
is that...

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.469
Woody.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.318
I'm not Andy's toy.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.673
What?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.637
It's time for the next kid.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.456
Oh, and thank you again
for everything.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.549
I really appreciate it.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.949
Oh, my pleasure.
I'm glad it all worked out.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.276
You know, kids lose
their toys every day.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.950
Sometimes they get
left in the yard...

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.916
or put in the wrong box.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.112
And that box gets taken away.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.395
Mom, where's Woody?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.158
Andy! Come inside!

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240
I can't find Woody!

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.749
Well, good night.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.671
Goodbye.
Drive safe.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.596
Oh, there you are.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.678
Mom, I found him! I found him!

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.513
Oh, good.
Come on and get inside.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.510
You've got a friend in me

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.790
Reach for the sky!

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.428
You've got a friend in me

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.951
Ride 'em, cowboy! Yee-haw!

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.720
When the road looks
rough ahead

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.472
There's a snake in my boot.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.520
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.677
You just remember
what your old pal said

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.831
Boy, you've got a friend in me

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.353
To infinity and beyond!

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.316
Yeah, you've got
a friend in me

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.271
My cowboy!

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.000
Now, some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.354
Big and stronger, too

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.032
Woody, let's go!

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200
Maybe

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.351
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.192
You're my favorite deputy!

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.394
It's me and you, boy

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.949
And as the years go by

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.194
Our friendship will never die

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.191
Reach for the sky!

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.039
You're gonna see
it's our destiny

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.634
They've escaped and they're
headed right for us!

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.994
You've got a friend in me

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.438
- Full speed ahead! Yay!
- You've got a friend in me

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.398
You've got a friend in me

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.656
It's getting hot in here!

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.776
Where's my ear?

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800
You're on my foot!

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.936
Oh, hey,
quit shoving.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.016
- Sorry!
- Could you move over

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.440
- a bit, please?
- That was my horn.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.896
To infinity and beyond!

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.200
I know that was you,
Potato Head.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.872
Everyone, listen.
I thought I told you...

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.951
when Mom quickly cleans
the bedroom like that...

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.792
expect to be put
in the closet.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.598
How much longer?

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.079
Keep it to a dull roar, Rex.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.872
Deep breaths, Jessie.
Deep breaths.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.456
Settle down, Slink.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.674
Sit. Good boy!

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.976
Sheriff,
do I need to be worried?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.976
No, no. My guys are veterans.
They'll hang in there.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.036
Good. Just keep them calm
until we get word.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.317
How are you, uh,
feeling about today?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.755
Uh, good, good. Yeah, good.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.029
I'm good.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.639
Uh... Good.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.791
We're on!
Bonnie's done with breakfast!

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.313
- Any minute now.
- You hear that?

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.594
Any minute now.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.749
Wind 'em if you got 'em.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.800
Keep your batteries clean,
your joints unlocked...

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.960
Uh, thanks, Woody.
I got it.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.270
Yes, I'm sorry.
You're right, you're right.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.988
The town is open!

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.080
Hi, Mayor!

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Banker!

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.838
Hi, Ice-Cream Man!
Hi, Hat Shop Owner!

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.354
Mailman!

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.998
And the sheriff!

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.671
Okay. Bye, toys!

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.637
Yee-haw! Sheriff Jessie!

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.472
Giddy-up, Bullseye!

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.674
They went that way!

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.995
Chase them!

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.828
What a beautiful hat shop!
You have so many hats...

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.536
Wow.
They're doing "hat shop."

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.816
When's the last time

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.875
we ever got to play that?

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.393
Remember when
she played "house"?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.515
I liked "house."

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.795
Those were the days.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.313
It was basic.
You made a house,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.440
you lived in it, done.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.153
Hmm. That's the third time

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.560
you haven't been picked
this week.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.953
I don't know.
I don't keep count.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.758
Oh, you don't have to.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.856
- I'll do it for you.
- Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.880
It's been a while.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.508
Oh, looky there.
You got your first dust bunny.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.673
Aw, how adorable.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.875
What you gonna name it?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.080
Uh, what about Dusty?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.296
- Francis!
- Harry!

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.416
- Karen!
- Fuzzball!

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.509
- LeBron?
- No, Fluffy.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.176
- How about Thumper?
- Tumbleweed!

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.880
"Tumbleweed."
Oh, that's good. That's good.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.016
He's a cowboy,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.176
so that makes a lot of sense.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.918
So many choices.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.274
I just can't decide!

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360
Bonnie?

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.714
What are you doing?
We gotta go.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.800
You don't wanna be late

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.136
for kindergarten orientation,
do you?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.355
But I don't wanna go.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.936
We talked about this.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.188
We're gonna meet
your teachers,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.111
- see your classroom...
- Can I bring a toy?

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.033
Toys don't go to school,
that's the rule.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.428
Freeze! Nobody move!

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.840
Bonnie always
forgets something.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.234
She'll be back any second.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.594
That goes for you, too, Hamm.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.760
But it's money!

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640
You all right, Woody?

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.856
I'm sure she'll pick you
next time.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.871
Oh, come on, I'm fine.
No problem.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.149
Hey, Woody. Here.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.309
Oh, thanks, Jessie.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.118
We're here for you, buddy.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.936
I don't want to play
the baker.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.960
Pricklepants.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.076
The hat shop owner is
the role I was born to play!

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.776
All right, Pricklepants,
back to your bakery.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.800
Excuse me, Dolly?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.296
Woody, can't you see
I'm threatening everyone?

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.320
Go back to the closet.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.456
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's just...

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.674
I'm worried about Bonnie.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.557
A toy should go with her
to orientation.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.680
Didn't you hear Dad?
You'll get Bonnie in trouble.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.512
Yeah, but kindergarten
is so different.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.193
It can be too much for a kid.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.616
Having a buddy with them
to get through it

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.640
can really help things.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.416
I remember with Andy, I would
go to school with him...

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.475
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, Woody,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.736
I hate to sound
like a broken record...

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.113
but Bonnie's not Andy.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.673
No, no, no, of course,
I get that.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.954
But if you would just...

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.593
Places, everyone!

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.514
Bonnie?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.832
What are you doing back there?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.070
Come on, we have to go.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.878
That's my big girl.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.474
Come on. We gotta hurry, okay?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.231
Don't forget your backpack.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.000
You're gonna
have so much fun.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.552
All right. Now what was it
you were saying, Woody?

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.874
Woody?

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.072
Here we are.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.830
Bonnie, honey,
it'll be okay.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.070
Hi! Are you Bonnie?

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.360
My name is Miss Wendy.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.120
I'm going to be
your kindergarten teacher.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.078
We have a special place where
you can put your backpack.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.072
You want to see?

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.991
Here we are, Bonnie.
Just for you.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.549
Okay, class, let's all find
a seat at a table...

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.955
so we can start craft time.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.348
On the first day of school,

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.510
you'll need a place
to put your pencils.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.877
So, today, we're going
to make pencil holders.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.359
Now, everyone take a cup...

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.592
and we'll use the art supplies
to decorate them.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.275
Hi.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.674
Bonnie. That is so clever.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.792
"Hello, I'm Forky.
Nice to meet you!"

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.672
Well, hello, Forky,
it's nice to meet you.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.193
I'm Miss Wendy.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.110
Mom! Dad!
Look what I made!

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.515
His name is Forky!

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.033
- Wow!
- That is so cool!

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.872
I finished kindergarten!

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.280
Uh...

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.828
No.
That was just orientation.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.399
But for being
such a brave girl,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.754
we have a surprise for you.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840
What is it?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.056
Since school doesn't start

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.548
for another week,
we are going on a road trip!

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.696
- Can I bring Forky?
- 'Course you can!

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.039
Yay!

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.032
And they said I shouldn't
go to school with Bonnie.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.069
We got this kindergarten thing
under control, eh?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.080
I can't believe
I'm talking to a spork.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.559
Hi, toys!
Bye, toys!

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.834
Ow.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.114
He did go to kindergarten!

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.616
- I knew it.
- No, no, no, guys, listen...

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.696
You tryin' to get
Bonnie in trouble?

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.835
No, of course not!

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.056
You could have been
confiscated.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.957
- What does that mean?
- Taken away.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.189
- No!
- Or worse.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280
You could've been lost!

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.480
No, no, no, guys, listen.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.153
Bonnie had a great day
in class...

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.560
and we're going
on a road trip.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.994
- Road trip?
- Vacation!

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.269
Yee-haw!

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.040
But then something
really weird happened.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.798
Bonnie made a friend in class.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.960
What a kid.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.216
Oh, she's already
making friends.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.152
No, no. She literally made
a new friend.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.192
Hey, it's okay.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.396
Come on out. That's it.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.357
Come on, there you go.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.557
Come on,
let's get you out of there.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.113
You got this.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.031
Good. Good.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.272
Everyone, I want you
to meet Forky.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.096
- Golly bob howdy!
- Look at that!

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.350
Look how long his arms are!

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.118
- Trash?
- No.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.157
No, toys.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.237
They're all toys.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.519
- Trash?
- No, no, no.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.636
That's the trash.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.949
These are your friends.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.593
Hi!

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.074
Trash!

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.576
- No, no, it's okay.
- Trash!

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.880
Woody,
I have a question.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.680
Um, well, actually,
not just one,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.795
I have all of them.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.513
I have all the questions.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.096
Uh, why does he want
to go to the trash?

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.320
Because he was made
from trash.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.360
Trash!

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.920
Look, I know
this is a little strange,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.200
but you gotta trust me
on this.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.240
Trash?

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.995
Forky is the most important
toy to Bonnie right now.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.280
Important?

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.389
He's a spork.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.198
Yes. Yeah, I know,
but this spork...

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.590
this toy is crucial to Bonnie

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.830
getting adjusted
to kindergarten. Oh.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.035
Woody, aren't you being

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.256
a little dramatic
about all this?

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.759
I know this is new
to everybody...

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.034
but you should see how much

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.599
this little guy
means to Bonnie.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.274
When she started
playing with him...

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.476
she had the biggest smile
on her face.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.840
I wish you could have seen it.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.000
Bonnie was really upset...

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.713
and I swear,
once she made Forky...

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.472
it was
a complete transformation.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.710
- Uh, Woody?
- Just a second, Jessie.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.435
So, we all have to make sure
nothing happens to him.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.352
Something happened to him.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.359
Oh, Chutes and Ladders!

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520
Ah, trash.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.776
- No, no, no!
- No! No!

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.136
You're a toy now,
Forky! Come on!

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.229
Stop! Stop it!

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.856
- Hey! No, no, no! Come on!
- Trash!

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.096
Trash! Trash!

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.350
Well, I guess
I'll just babysit him

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.754
till he's used to the room.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.474
Hmm.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.234
Forky?

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.038
Where are you, Forky?

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.789
There you are!

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.916
I thought I'd lost you, silly.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.154
No, no, no.
Big girl scary!

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.880
Like I said before,
Bonnie's not scary.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.792
She loves you
and you need to...

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.108
Ooh.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.953
Forky?

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.113
Bonnie!

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.480
Let's go!

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.790
Rise and shine!

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.552
Who wants to go
on a road trip?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.154
Me! I'm gonna bring
Dolly, and Buttercup...

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.151
and Forky, and...

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.072
Forky? Where are you?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.576
He's gotta be
here somewhere.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.600
Forky?

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.760
Forky!

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.480
Come on. Let's eat some
breakfast and hit the road!

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.113
Let's go, Forky!

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.272
Whoa. He's quite
a handful, Woody.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.040
You need help with him
on the road trip?

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.714
No. No, no. I got it,
I got it.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.957
We'll just be stuck in an RV.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.792
He can't get far.
I got this.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880
I got it.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.398
I can't let you

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.751
I can't let you

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.431
I can't let you
throw yourself away

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.111
- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.236
I can't let you
throw yourself away

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.956
Don't you want to see
the sun come up each morning?

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.792
No, no!

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.269
Don't you want to see
the sun go down each day?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.949
Don't you want to see that
little girl that loves you so?

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.712
Her heart would break

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.869
Oh, yeah!

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.439
If you should go

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.677
- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.016
I can't let you
throw yourself away

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.075
No, no, no!

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.560
No! No! No!

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.632
So it seems to me like you're
never gonna behave yourself

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.313
Since I'm not gonna
do this every day

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.628
Come tomorrow, you're gonna
have to save yourself

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.756
Got nothing more to say

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.593
You're not listening anyway

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.878
- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.056
Trash, here I come!

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.216
I can't let you
throw yourself away

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.389
Come on.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.318
I can't let you

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.952
I can't let you

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.376
I can't let you
throw yourself away

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.356
I don't wanna be a toy!

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.998
- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.789
I can't let you
throw yourself away

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.069
Hey, buddy.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.508
Hey, Buzz.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.228
You doing okay?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400
I don't know, Buzz.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.755
I know you weren't around
when Andy was little...

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.559
but I don't remember it
being this hard.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.639
Want me to take
the next watch?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.760
I'll keep an eye on Forky.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.917
No, no. I need to do this.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.229
That little voice inside me

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.436
would never leave me alone
if I gave up.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.915
Huh.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.473
Who do you think it is?

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.709
Who?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.394
The voice inside of you.
Who do you think it is?

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.315
Uh...

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.675
Me.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.114
You know, my conscience?

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.148
That part of you
that tells you things?

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.480
What you're really thinking?

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.279
Fascinating.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.113
So, your inner voice
advises you.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.320
What?

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.280
It's a secret
mission in uncharted space.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.360
Let's go.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.040
Where's Forky?

00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.954
Oh, no!
Forky!

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.995
Forky!

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.594
I am not a toy!

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.874
I'm a spork.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960
Be quiet!

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.439
I was made for soup, salad...

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.636
maybe chili,
and then the trash.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.074
I'm litter!

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.160
Freedom!

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.672
Hamm, how far
to our next stop?

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.478
5.32 miles, give or take.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.675
I can make that.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.068
I'll meet you at the RV park.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.071
Woody, hold on a minute.
Woody!

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.873
Forky!

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.475
Forky, where are you?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.073
Forky!

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.593
Forky, where are you?

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.478
- Carry me?
- No.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.872
Why do I have to be a toy?

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.176
Because you have Bonnie's name

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.713
written on the bottom
of your sticks.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.960
Why do I have Bonnie's name

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.598
written on the bottom
of my sticks?

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.034
Because she...

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.349
Look, she plays with you
all the time, right?

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.714
Ugh. Yes.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.751
And who does she sleep with
every night?

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.148
The big white fluffy thing?

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.594
No, not her pillow.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.028
You.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.997
All right, Forky.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.675
You have to understand
how lucky you are right now.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.989
You're Bonnie's toy.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.355
You are going to help create
happy memories...

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.596
that will last
for the rest of her life.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.955
Huh? What?

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.233
Okay.
Doing it for Bonnie.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.391
Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.711
Okay, like it or not,
you are a toy.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.393
Maybe you don't like
being one,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.674
but you are one nonetheless.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.988
Which means you are going

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.280
to be there for Andy
when he...

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.594
Who's Andy?

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.515
I mean, Bonnie.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.272
You have to be there
for Bonnie.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.112
That is your job.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.554
Well, what's your job?

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.910
Well, right now, it's to make
sure you do yours.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.672
- Carry me?
- No!

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.909
Who's Andy?

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.631
Andy was my other kid.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.991
You had another kid?

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.873
For a long time.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.072
And it was pretty great.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.156
I was a favorite toy,
actually.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.470
Running the room was my job.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.039
Keeping all the toys
in place...

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.873
So, he thought
Andy's room was a planet?

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.752
Wow,
that is messed up.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.875
Right!

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.616
That's exactly what I thought
when he first showed up.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.870
Yeah. I mean,
how is that not annoying?

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.190
- Thank you!
- Seriously, that is the...

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.112
Well, then you
watch 'em grow up

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.997
and become a full person.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.552
And then they leave.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.950
They go off and do things
you'll never see.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.959
Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.792
But then somehow
you find yourself,

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.995
after all those years...

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.038
sitting in a closet
just feeling...

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.189
Useless?

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.269
Yeah.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.317
Your purpose fulfilled?

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.512
Exactly.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.272
Woody, I know
what your problem is.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.360
You do?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.919
You're just like me.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.115
Trash!

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.872
What is it with you and trash?

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.439
- It's warm.
- Ew.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.874
- It's cozy.
- I guess.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.040
And safe!

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.792
Like somebody's
whispering in your ear,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.313
"Everything's gonna be okay."

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.757
Forky, that's it.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.639
That's how Bonnie feels
when she's with you.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.358
- She does?
- Yes!

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.795
Wait a sec.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.991
- You mean she thinks I'm warm?
- Yep.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.229
- And cozy?
- Uh-huh.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.714
And sometimes kinda squishy?

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.108
Well, that, too. Yes.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.799
I get it now.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.029
I'm Bonnie's trash.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.275
Yes! Wait, what?

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.555
I am Bonnie's trash!

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.720
No, no, no, not exactly.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.216
She must be feeling awful
without me.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.536
Woody, we got to get going,
she needs me!

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.440
- Yeah... Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.795
Forky, slow down! Forky!

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.239
Bonnie, I'm coming!

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400
Forky!

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.149
Forky, look.
Bonnie's right over there.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.474
Hurry!

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.435
Whoo!

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.158
Huh? Woody?

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.435
Bo?

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.754
Woody?

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.477
Aren't we going to Bonnie?

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.915
I know, I know. But my friend
might be in there.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.189
Friend?

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.839
Oh, a friend, uh...

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.519
Well, a friend is...

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.079
Well, a friend is
like you and me.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.231
- Trash?
- Trash, like... Yes.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.016
And I'm very worried
that she might be lost.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.190
But, Woody,
Bonnie's right there.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.520
Yeah, we'll have you back
before she wakes up. Come on.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.515
Bo?

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720
Bo?

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.635
Bo?

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.311
- Bo?
- Bo?

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.120
Bo?

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.320
Bo.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.833
Bo, Bo, Bo...

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.958
- Bo?
- Bo?

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.114
Can we go back to Bonnie now?

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.349
I don't see your friend.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.999
Yeah, okay.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.479
She's not in here.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.834
Come on, let's go.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.315
Is that Bo?

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.389
Uh...
Hey, howdy.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.629
Hey there.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.119
Uh, sorry to bother you,
but...

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.080
Why,
you're not a bother at all.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.230
We were just out
for my early morning stroll.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.515
And look...

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.511
we met you!

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.874
My name is Gabby Gabby.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.434
And this is my
very good friend Benson.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.591
Oh, uh, Woody.
Pleasure to meet you.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.035
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Woody. And you are...?

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720
This is Forky.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.035
I'm trash.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.917
Our kid made him.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.150
Kid? Toys around here
don't have kids.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320
Are you two lost?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.391
Lost? No, no.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.273
But we are looking
for a lost toy.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.000
She's a figurine. Used to be
on that lamp in the window?

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.160
Name's Bo Peep?

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.389
Bo Peep?

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.675
- Oh, yes, I know Bo.
- You do?

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.120
Hop on in.
We'll take you to her.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.838
Oh, you don't have to do that.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.228
Well, okay.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.795
Benson, be careful
with our new friends.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.039
Wow, what service.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.076
Uh...
Thank you for your help.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.240
I haven't seen Bo in years.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.072
May I ask, when were you made?

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.559
Me? Uh...

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.432
I'm not sure. Late '50s?

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600
Me, too!

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.760
Gee, I wonder if we were made
in the same factory.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.552
Wouldn't that be something?

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.631
I gotta say,
you are in great condition.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.837
Well, I try to stay active.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.709
And look at that,
you have a voice box like me.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.880
Benson, show him.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.434
Oh, that's really
not necessary.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.708
I'm Gabby Gabby

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.677
and I love you.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.832
Wow, you need to fix that.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.831
My record works just fine.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.712
It's the voice box
that's broken.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.920
Does yours still work?

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Hey!

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.560
There's a snake in my boot!

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.790
Listen to that!
Let's see it.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.109
I bet it's the same type.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.475
No, thanks,
mine's sewn inside.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.159
Is Bo around here?
Because we need...

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.669
Oh.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.113
The store is about to open.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.360
Don't worry, we'll take you
where no one will see us.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.152
Oh, no. We can't stay.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.469
Yes, you can.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.148
We gotta go.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.437
You can't leave yet.
You have what I need.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.512
Right inside there.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.976
Returned that lamp
the next day.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.056
You're kidding me!

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.798
Mom, can we go
to the park now?

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.995
Harmony!

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.317
Stop him, please.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.800
What's going on?

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.074
Come on! Let's go!

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.958
He's coming, he's coming!
I see him!

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.997
Forky? We got to get out of...

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.435
Woody!

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.959
I'd like
to join your posse, boys.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.270
But first, I'm gonna sing
a little song.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.992
Grandma, look what I found.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.991
- Can I take it to the park?
- Sure.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.833
Mom, she has enough toys
from the store.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.151
Oh, it's fine.
Nobody buys the toys anyway.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.038
Thanks, Grandma!

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.912
Yee-haw!

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.632
Mom, can we go
to the carnival?

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.240
We're going
to the park.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.320
Maybe later, sweetie.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.675
Any sign of Woody?

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.068
- I don't see him!
- Shh!

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.136
Maybe we should
have gone with the fork.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.160
The spoon is safer.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.480
Mmm.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.392
Forky?

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.909
Where's Forky?

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.320
Mom! Dad!

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.696
- What's wrong, honey?
- Are you okay?

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.631
I can't find Forky!
He's missing!

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.199
Oh, Bonnie,
it'll be all right.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.032
I'm sure he's here somewhere.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.440
You know,
if you don't find him,

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520
you can make a new one.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.796
No! There's only one Forky!

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.029
Uh...

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.394
Let's go look outside.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.960
Maybe he fell on the ground
somewhere.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.669
Oh, poor Bonnie.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.976
We're gonna
find him, okay?

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.389
We have to find him,
Mom. He needs me.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.595
Woody was right.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.796
We all should have been
safeguarding the utensil.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.154
Why isn't Woody back yet?

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.440
Do you think
he's lost?

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.136
- Buzz, what do we do?
- What do we do, Buzz?

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.760
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.440
- What do we do, Buzz? Buzz!
- I, uh...

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.039
- Buzz.
- What would Woody do?

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.720
Eh, jump out
of a moving vehicle.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.472
What would Woody do?

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.856
It's a secret mission

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.438
in uncharted space. Let's go!

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.228
I think I have to go.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.456
- Where?
- Where you goin'? Why?

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.480
Should we all go?

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.656
- Are we going?
- And then what?

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.160
No time to explain!
Attack!

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.514
No time to explain!

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.875
- Oh, no!
- Buzz!

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.040
Okay, what is with everyone
jumping out the window?

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.710
Woody and Forky were last seen
on the highway.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.393
But where is the highway?

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.896
The slingshot
maneuver is all we've got!

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.353
Full speed ahead!

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.519
Thanks, inner voice!

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.195
Hi-ya!

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440
The highway.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.639
On my way, Woody!

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.268
Rad.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.079
Hey! Step right up!

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.240
Put your money down!

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.416
Get yourself
a real Buzz Lightyear!

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.953
Hey! Hey!

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.556
Harmony, honey. Sunscreen.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.760
Okay.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.990
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.919
Okay. Antique store,
antique store...

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.080
Oh, that way!

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.716
Did you see 'em?
How many are there?

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.075
- Whoa, whoa.
- We got a busload of campers!

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.116
Here they come!

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.840
- Huh?
- Playtime, baby!

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.875
Oh, baby!
It's a good day to play, huh?

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.155
Am I right?

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.595
Huh?

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.592
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy.
How are you today?

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.557
"Do you like riding horses?"

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.158
Wanna play
on the swings?

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.440
Wait for me!

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.114
Bo?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.235
Come on.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.600
Bo!

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.160
Oh, I can't
believe it's you!

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.593
Bo Peep!

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.318
I never thought
I'd see you again!

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.576
- So, which kid is yours?
- Which one is yours?

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.715
- None.
- No one.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.950
- Wait, you're a lost toy?
- You're a lost toy?

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.320
- That's awful.
- That's great.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.069
- Huh?
- I mean, awfully great...

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.993
that you are lost out here.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.200
- Skunk, skunk, skunk!
- Watch out!

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.276
Huh?

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.832
I told you
not to drive so fast.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.194
You almost ran him over.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.434
Oh, hey, guys!

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.794
Whoa! Hold on there!

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.757
Okay!
I missed you, too.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.832
If it isn't Bobby?
Gus?

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.955
Uh...

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.109
Lefty?

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.435
Billy, Goat, and Gruff.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.272
Right! Right! Right!
Sorry, guys.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.112
- Girls.
- Girls! Of course!

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.600
All right, all right.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.632
Okay, let's get a look at you.
You need any repairs?

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.756
Repairs? No, I'm fine.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.950
Hey! Nice find, girls.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.256
Where did you get
all this stuff?

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.280
Here and there.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.113
You know, some kids
play rougher than others...

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.872
so I try
to be prepared.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.560
How long have you been
out on your own?

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.352
Seven fantastic years!

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.555
Seven?

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.029
You would not believe
the things I've seen.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.348
Uh, no.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.595
- Gigs.
- Yo!

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.640
Come on out. There's someone
I want you to meet.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.189
Be right down.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.068
What's the situation?
We heading out of town or...

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.508
Whoa! Who's this?

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.360
You remember the rag doll
I told you about?

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.635
- The cowboy?
- Yep!

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.473
No way!

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.800
- Don't stare.
- I'm totally staring.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.475
Woody,
this is Giggle McDimples.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.920
Oh, hi, Giggle.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.877
Whoa, you didn't tell me
he was a cop.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.189
Howdy, Sheriff.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.839
Officer Giggle McDimples.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.751
I run Pet Patrol
for Mini-Opolis.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.955
Yeah, search and rescue.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.120
Ants, caterpillars,

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.896
- miniature poodles, spiders.
- Hut! Hut! Hut!

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.512
Carl! Where you headed?

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.456
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.913
at the playground
on Main Street.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.672
Rumor has it
they got two piĂ±atas.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.070
- That could be 20 to 30 kids.
- Nice!

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.999
Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's
gettin' played with!

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.680
You guys in?

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.354
You bet! Woody,
you are gonna love this!

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.312
Uh, no, I can't, sir.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.152
Bo, I need to get back
to my kid.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.832
- What?
- You got a kid?

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.035
Yeah.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.800
Way to beat
the odds, soldier.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.680
Meet you
at the playground, Peep.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.434
Combat Carl's got
a piĂ±ata party to crash.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.795
All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.348
So, you're, uh, with a kid?

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.560
It's not Andy, is it?

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.671
No, no, no.
He went off to college.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.637
But he gave us to Bonnie.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.631
- You have a little girl?
- No way!

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.199
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.679
Her other toy is trapped

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.976
in this antique store,
and I have to...

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.752
Second Chance Antiques?

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.148
We know that store.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.759
That's great. That is great!

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.478
If you know the store,
you could really

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.760
- help me find him...
- No way.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.920
We wasted years there,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.616
just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.119
Oh, Bo, that's awful.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.349
But I don't have a choice.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.158
I have to get that toy
from Gabby.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.873
Whoa. Steer clear
of that weirdo.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.310
If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.516
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.910
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.559
No, no...

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.269
You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.239
Aw, no. Sorry, girls.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.760
Molly's not here.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.711
Molly? Bo,
I didn't know you had a kid.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.711
That was a long time ago.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.996
Oh, Bo's kid was
something special.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.798
She was the cutest thing...

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.598
but so afraid of the dark.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.353
It was just a phase.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.936
Oh, you weren't there
in the beginning.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.871
Hearing Molly cry
each night...

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.190
it broke every toy's heart.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.633
And then,
Bo came into the room.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.588
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.751
Mom would let her keep Bo on
all night.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.717
Ha! Who knew you were
such a softy?

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.148
And Molly would fall asleep

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.310
with her hand
resting on Bo's feet.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.630
Okay! Okay. I get it.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.554
Bo, my kid really needs
this toy.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.392
Will you help me?
For old times' sake.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.633
All right, all right.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.392
Thank you! Oh!

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.640
- Oh, thank you!
- All right.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.512
Guess we're doing this.
Let's ride!

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.999
Second Chance Antiques,
and step on it.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.877
Ow!

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.508
Hey, hey!

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.936
- Benson, are we finished?
- Ow!

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.552
Oh, that feels great!

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.318
Look at that! Good as new.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.948
Yeah. Thank you, uh, Benson.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.029
Uh, so, um, when's Woody
coming back?

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.872
Like I said, soon.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.234
He won't forget about you.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.440
How do you know?

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.114
You have your child's name
written on your feet.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.320
Sticks.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.675
That makes you
a very important toy.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.398
That's exactly
what Woody says.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.456
Hmm. Interesting.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.656
Hi, Grandma!
We're back!

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.680
She's back.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.200
Who is she?

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.320
Harmony.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.480
Wait a second...

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.868
she took Woody.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.314
Did she lose him?

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.392
No. My Harmony is perfect.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.656
Forky, it's tea time.
It's tea time.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.717
- Whoo-hoo! What is tea time?
- Oh, I'll show you.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.155
A little bit of milk,
two lumps of sugar.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.276
I've been practicing.
How do I look?

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.955
Uh... A little higher.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.994
Stick out your pinky.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.400
Nice!

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.348
Mmm! Delicious!

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.280
Harmony, sweetie, I'm leaving.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.588
Come give me a hug.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.671
Bye, Mom.
I love you.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.031
When my voice box is fixed...

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.994
I'll finally get my chance.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.869
Now, about our friend Woody.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.514
I wanna know
everything about him.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:47.840
Oh, yeah, Woody.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.791
I've known that guy
my whole life. Two days!

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.230
Hey, did you know that
Bonnie was not his first kid?

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.311
He had this other kid, Andy.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.400
And you know what?

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.040
I don't think
he's ever gotten over him.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.312
Psst. Hey, Lightyear.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.079
Hey, up here,
Astro-boy.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.832
If you think you can
just show up

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.717
and take our top prize spot...

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.000
- you're wrong!
- Dead wrong!

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.712
You don't understand.
I'm trying to...

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.880
Cheat the system and get
with a kid? Yeah, we know.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.319
No, I need...

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.311
A child to shower you
with unconditional love?

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.516
- Join the club, pal.
- Yeah, join the club!

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.159
Come on,
help me get outta here.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.072
I'll help you. With my foot!

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.639
Get him.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.392
Get him.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:34.696
- Bunny, what are you doing?
- Hmm?

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.075
I can't reach him.
Help me out here, come on.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.176
Oh, sorry, Ducky. I'm not
a mind reader, you know.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.952
What's not to understand, hmm?

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.120
You gonna make me say it?

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.872
What?

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.394
With these tiny legs, I cannot
reach without your help.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.629
Uh-huh. Okay?
This is what

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.920
I've been talking about,
Bunny.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.176
You need to work
on paying attention

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.296
and your listening skills.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.435
Ha!

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.192
How you like that, cheater?
Huh?

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.749
Yeah!

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.071
Oh, to infinity and my foot!
Boom!

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.669
In a galaxy far, far away,
you got kicked in the head!

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.760
Boom!

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.273
How do I get out of here?

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.834
This planet is toxic.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.672
Closing helmet
to conserve oxygen.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.816
In the vacuum of space,
they cannot hear you scream!

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.114
Ow!

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.200
Let go of me!

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.554
Get off of me!

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.936
Ooh! So, that's what
gravity feel like.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.960
Yeah, that's it.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.040
Hey, where you going?

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.056
You better get
over here, spaceman!

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.798
Yeah, put us
back up there!

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.656
Bunny, what are you doing?
He's getting away, let's go!

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.680
- I'm trying!
- Come on!

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.191
Antique store, here we come!

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.112
Bo, why do you ride around
in a skunk?

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.077
Whoa! Skunk!

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.389
A skunk!

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.152
Oh, I get it. Smart.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.839
Corndogs, corndogs, corndogs!

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.560
Why are you so bad at driving?

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.517
You got six eyes.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.472
Thanks for the landing.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.120
- Uh...
- Come on, follow me.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.976
- I'm fine.
- His face!

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.416
- That's hilarious.
- I'm fine. Don't worry.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.919
Happens all the time.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.080
Tape!

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.515
Not a bad hiding spot.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.914
Yeah.
Leave the skunk.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.520
- We'll fix it later.
- 10-4.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.232
This will be more fun.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.753
Let's get you to that store!

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.310
Okay, spill it.
The cowboy, what's the deal?

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.839
- There's no deal.
- Uh-huh.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.070
Don't do this to yourself.
Cowboy's got a kid.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.310
- Giggle...
- Trust me. I've been there.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.596
You know about me and He-Man.
I'm not proud.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.033
Shh! Here he comes!

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.718
- Oh, man...
- What?

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.153
No, not you.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.117
Second Chance Antiques,
straight ahead.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.656
Heavy foot traffic
at the entrance.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.193
Easiest way in is

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.480
- the roof.
- The roof!

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.231
Let's go antiquing.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.120
Hold on!

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.795
Huh?

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.675
Whoa!

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.988
How did you end up here?

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.736
I thought you were given
to a new family.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.909
Oh, you know how it goes.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.195
Their little girl grew up

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.953
and didn't need me anymore,
so...

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.473
Oh, I'm sorry, Bo.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.471
Eh, who needs a kid's room...

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.633
when you can have all of this?

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.513
Whatcha looking at, Sheriff?

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.954
What? Oh, uh...

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.271
That wasn't...
No, uh, nothing.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.798
I was looking at the store.
Right there.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.552
I was looking
at the antique store.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.591
- Giggle, count us down.
- Five.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.840
- Countdown for what?
- Four.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.176
You want to get to the store,
don't you?

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.200
Three. Two. One!

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.751
The highway exit
has to be somewhere.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.273
Where is it?

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.476
Meteor shower! Look out!

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.840
Woody?

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.993
Good work, inner voice.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.511
So, how about you?
How's your new kid?

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.069
Bonnie?
Oh, she's great.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.275
Jessie is loving it.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.440
Jessie's still with you?

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.636
Oh, yeah, the whole gang's
still together.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.313
Well, I mean, most of us.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.720
What about Rex?

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.911
Yeah, yeah, Rex,
Bullseye, Slinky...

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.752
- the Potato Heads...
- Buzz?

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:10.989
Yeah, Buzz, too.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.958
I cannot wait to see his face
when he hears that I found...

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.872
- Bo Peep?
- Buzz!

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.678
- My old moving buddy!
- Buzz?

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.829
It's so good to see you!

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.035
Woody, it's Bo Peep!

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.280
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.776
Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.856
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.199
- Three years!
- Three years!

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.360
That's how long we've been

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.656
hanging up there
waiting for a kid!

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.760
Look, I'm sorry about that.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.797
You ruined our lives.
Shame on you!

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.552
Who are these guys?

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.520
- Lightyear promised us a kid.
- You did what?

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.976
I did not.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.616
- Hey! Wait a minute!
- Eat my plush!

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.776
All right now,
come on, stop it!

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800
Cut it out now!

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.080
Come on, guys, break it up.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.160
Guys, I have a kid!

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.430
You got a kid?

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.600
Like a kid-kid?

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.916
Like a human kid,
not a baby goat?

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.036
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz
and come with me.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.269
I'll take you to Bonnie.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.839
- We're gettin' a kid?
- Yes!

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.096
We're gettin' a kid?

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.951
- We're gonna get a kid
- Kid

00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.576
- We're getting a kid
- All right, let's go.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.096
- We gonna get something, oh
- We gonna uh, uh, uh

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.270
- Where's Forky?
- Long story.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.914
- Kid, we get a kid
- Kid, kid, kid

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.550
- We gonna kid
- We gonna kid, kid

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.874
He's not anywhere.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.511
Forky's gone.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.193
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.749
Okay. Let's look outside
one more time.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.559
But then we have to keep
driving, okay?

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.199
They're about to leave!

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.856
- Leaving?
- They can't do that!

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.836
The panic is attacking me!

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.911
- Hey! Watch it, buddy!
- What do we do?

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.399
- We have to stop them!
- How?

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.040
We could frame Dad for
a crime so he goes to jail.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.589
Or go back in time and warn
Woody about the future.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.896
That's crazy.
Time is a flat circle.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.920
Jessie!

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.233
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360
We looked everywhere.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.736
But we need
to get going now, okay?

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.176
Can we please leave a note
for Forky...

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.679
so he knows where we're going?

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.956
He has to go to kindergarten.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.509
Huh?

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.991
Are you kidding me?
I can't...

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.678
Everything is going perfect...
I just bought it.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.776
Okay! Daddy's
going to use some words.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.279
How about we go
to the carnival?

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.079
Or maybe check out
some of those shops in town?

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.473
What did you do?

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.837
We're not going anywhere.
If you get my point.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.056
- Brilliant!
- That was genius!

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.080
Nice work, Jessie!

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.080
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are on
their way back right now.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.475
Whoa!

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.240
Forky is in there?

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.320
Yeah.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.496
Now, hold on.
I have a question.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.034
Who will Bonnie love more?
Ducky or me? Say me.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.720
- No, say Ducky. Ducky.
- Bunny. Bunny.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:33.960
Okay, guys.
Playtime is over.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.353
You have to follow my lead.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.034
We stay together,
we stay quiet. Are we clear?

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.798
Absolutely.
Lead the way.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.960
- Are you kidding me?
- Move over.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.176
- You move over.
- Quit pushing me.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.474
- Stop.
- Shh!

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.630
Oh, my maker!
That sheep has three heads!

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.720
No, no, no!

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.189
What? All six eyes
just looked into my soul.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.628
Gonna have nightmares.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.028
That's most likely where
your Forky is being kept.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.296
All right,
this isn't so bad.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.276
We just can't be seen
by the dummies.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.714
Not just the dummies.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.316
Her cabinet is surrounded
by a moat of exposed aisle.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.675
Where Dragon roams.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.149
- We can handle a cat.
- No.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.548
Not this one.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.873
Is that how we look
on the inside?

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.270
- There's so much...
- fluff.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.816
So, how do you propose
we get up there?

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.558
We could go straight across.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.392
- How?
- That's quite a jump.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.437
We know the perfect toy
to help.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.896
Oh, Bonnie, check it out.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.760
- Look at all this cool stuff.
- Bonnie?

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.433
We gotta get
Forky now!

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.794
Woody, don't...

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.359
- Stick to the plan.
- 10-4.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.158
- Follow me.
- Roger that.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.874
Woody just sits in the closet?
With no playtime?

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.275
Yeah, he told me himself,
he's useless.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.509
That's awful.

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.999
Such pretty hair...

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.715
What are you doing?

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.120
You need to stick to the plan.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.593
But it's Bonnie.
She's right...

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.320
Can we go
to the carnival, too?

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.440
...there.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.511
Come on. Stay quiet.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.233
You better hope
the dummies didn't...

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.108
Whoa!

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.073
My sheep!

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.390
What did I say?
I lead. You follow.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.233
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.
Just tell me how to help.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.509
You really wanna help?

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.114
Then stay out of my way.
I'm getting my sheep back.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.360
What about the others?

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.953
Giggle knows what to do.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.160
- Here you go.
- That's our objective.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.117
We have to get that key.

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.696
It's the only way
inside the cabinet.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.073
You can't be serious.

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.360
How are we supposed
to do that?

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.748
Okay.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.200
You know what,
leave that to us.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.316
- We know exactly what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.395
Aw.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.311
Where did you two come from?

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.710
The keys! Give 'em
up now! Where are they?

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.240
Give us the keys!
Give us the keys!

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.000
Well, we're not doing that.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.296
Yeah, yeah, I agree,
too visible.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.696
It's a good point.
Something more subtle.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.216
Ooh, what about "Winner,
winner, chicken dinner"?

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.240
Yes.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.875
The keys! Give 'em
up now! Where are they?

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.992
- Uh... you're kidding.
- Really?

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.713
Okay, okay. You just...

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.108
All right. Well...

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.156
Oh, what about the old
"Plush Rush"?

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.355
There you go!

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.000
- Argh. Where is this going?
- Shh! Don't interrupt.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.120
- Okay, right?
- Uh-huh?

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.310
Not gonna happen.
N-O.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.152
Okay, do you want
the key or not?

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.480
What is wrong with you?

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.520
What is wrong with...?

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.636
We just gave you
three brilliant ideas.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.073
It's one thing
to say no.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.718
It's another to offer
a reason...

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.319
How do we get that key?

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.153
You're kidding!

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.389
Really?

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.788
Woody's back?

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.995
Woody's back?

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.957
And you're sure it's Bo Peep
who's with him?

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.440
Thank you, Benson.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.840
Make sure the others
are ready.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.909
Woody's back!

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.071
I'm coming, Bonnie!

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.040
Bonnie.

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.156
First, we must prepare
for his arrival.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.395
Prepare?

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.736
Have you ever played
hide-and-seek?

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.876
No. But it sounds complicated.

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.040
Oh, it's easy.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.673
- I'll teach you, okay?
- Okay.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.273
The first thing you do is...

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.511
one of us finds a place
to hide...

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.600
Scary.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.136
...while
the other one counts to ten...

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.752
then tries to find them.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.233
- What are we doing?
- Shh!

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.159
Just stand there and be quiet!

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.037
I'll do the talking.

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.072
Hi, Tinny!

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.832
Aw, nice to see you, too.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.917
Yeah, he's with me.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.599
My friend? No, no, no.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.512
He's my accessory.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.478
- Hey, guys.
- Bo!

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.710
Long time no see.

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.273
Couldn't take it
out there, huh?

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.588
Hey, Doug.
Saw your better half

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.789
at the front of the store.

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.314
Yeah, you mess with the cat,
you get the claws.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400
Bo came back!

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.680
Magic 8-Ball was right!

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.796
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.836
I thought the store
had no return policy!

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.115
Bo, help me out.

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.536
I need a battery.

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.279
We got to get
this wagon train a-movin'!

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.856
- Agreed.
- Help, help, help.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.880
Cheater.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.155
Have you seen Duke?

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.634
He's in the back.

00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.757
Look who jumped
40 school buses

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.068
and landed back into my life.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.356
- Hi, Duke!
- Who's the cowboy?

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.237
Duke, meet Woody.
Woody, meet...

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.437
Duke Caboom.
Canada's greatest stuntman.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.112
Oh, yeah!

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.395
- Yes!
- Huh?

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.993
He's posing.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.675
Duke?

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.831
- Duke, we need to...
- Hold on. One more.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.150
Oh, yeah!
What brings you back, Peep?

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.355
We need your help.

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:24.711
Gabby Gabby has his toy
and my sheep.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.917
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
Those are my girls.

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.113
What were you doing
getting tangled up

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.593
with Gabby Gabby?
You know better.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.069
Yeah, some toy thought
it would be a good idea...

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.280
to wander into the aisle.

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.834
That doesn't make any sense.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.194
It doesn't, does it?

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.589
Everybody knows the best route
is behind the shelves.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.990
That would have been
a better route, wouldn't it?

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.991
Wow, this toy sounds like
a complete idiot.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.672
He does!

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.557
Wait, are you that toy?

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.473
So, here's the plan.

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.200
We need to jump over the aisle
to Gabby's cabinet.

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.079
- And you are the toy to do it.
- No.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.309
- Duke.
- Nope.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.799
- Duke? Duke?
- Nuh-uh. No way!

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.279
- Duke. Duke!
- Pass. Negative.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.475
- Duke.
- Rejected.

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.516
Oh, please, Mr. Caboom,
this is really important.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.635
My kid...

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.800
You have a kid?

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.552
Uh...

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.029
Hey, Duke, show us some more
poses, what do you say?

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.111
- I had a kid.
- Oh, no.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.919
Rejean.

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.550
Rejean was so excited when
he got me after Christmas.

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.071
It was the happiest Boxing Day
of my life.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.200
That's Duke Caboom,

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.510
riding the amazing
Caboom stunt cycle!

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.113
Caboom!

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.837
I was ready to finally
do what I was made to do.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.433
Caboom!

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.431
But when Rejean realized
I couldn't jump

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.112
as far as the toy
in the commercial...

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.313
It's a commercial!
It's not real!

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.913
Rejean threw me away!

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.195
It's not fair!

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.237
Why, Rejean? Why?

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.071
Okay, okay.
Calm down, Duke.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.798
That was a long time ago.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.152
Right now,
we need the only toy

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.669
who can crash us
onto Gabby's cabinet.

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.830
Crash?

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.956
Any Duke Caboom toy
can land...

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.948
but you are the only one
that can crash the way you do.

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.439
- I am?
- Yes!

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.029
Forget Rejean.
Forget your commercial.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.395
Be the Duke
you are right now...

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.597
the one who jumps and crashes!

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.676
Be who I am right now.

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.756
Who's the Canuck
with all the luck?

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.600
Caboom?

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.557
Who's the greatest
of the Great White North?

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.640
Caboom!

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.438
Who's the most spectacular
daredevil

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.669
Canada has ever seen?

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.473
Duke Caboom!

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.909
Can you do the jump?

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.116
Yes, I Canada!

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.838
Uh-huh.

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.911
- We've got our ride.
- Yes!

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.833
Yee-haw!

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.589
Yo, Bo!

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.591
Gigs! You made it!

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.029
Good work!

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.349
How'd you get it?

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.796
How do we get that key?

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.713
- It was hard.
- Very difficult.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:03.313
- Barely made it out alive.
- Yeah.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.549
So, you're welcome.

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.711
Okay. Let's do this.

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.471
Let me wrap that up for you.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.074
Don't want anything to happen
to it on the way home.

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.435
Good. That sale buys us
some time.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.709
Wait for it.

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.752
All right, let's go!

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.510
So, how long were you in here?

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.079
I don't know.
Couple years.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.392
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf
waiting for my life to happen.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560
So, I left.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.915
Wow.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.310
You've handled this lost toy
life better than I could.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.153
Aw, Sheriff.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.192
You're selling yourself short.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.435
I think you'd make
a great lost toy.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.035
You really don't think

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.917
you'll ever be in a kid's room
again, huh?

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.080
Nope.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.776
And now with the carnival
traveling through,

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.976
it's our chance
to hop a ride...

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.991
- and leave town.
- You're leaving?

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.160
Sure am.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.560
You ever think about getting
out there, seeing the world?

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.238
Without a kid?

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.238
No. You can't teach
this old toy new tricks.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.311
You'd be surprised.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.712
So, how'd you end up in
this store in the first place?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.189
Well, I saw your lamp
in the window...

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.796
and I thought maybe
you were inside...

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.956
and so I, uh...

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.029
Wow.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.268
Yeah.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720
Will you look at that?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.992
This is the only part
of the store I ever liked.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.912
That's gonna be quite a jump
for you and Duke.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.435
For me?

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.416
Didn't I tell you?
You're going with him.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.440
I am?

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.829
Let's caboom.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.399
It'll be fine,
Duke's the best.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.073
Yeah, at crashing.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.389
And now!

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.755
Go!

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840
Whoa!

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.237
Huh? Rejean.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.954
It's a commercial.
It's not real!

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.190
I can't do this!
I'm sorry, Rejean!

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.993
No, no, no!

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.677
What's new, pussycat?

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.873
- Forky?
- Girls?

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.720
Forky, where are you?

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.472
You're never
gonna find me.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.680
Forky?

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.910
Woody!
How'd you find me?

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.877
- Bo, I found him!
- Hi.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.634
Wait, it's an actual fork?

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.308
Bo! Bo! Bo!

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.033
Buzz!
The dummies are gone!

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.077
What?
Where'd they go?

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360
Okay, we can go now!

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.760
- No. I need to find my girls.
- Hello, Woody.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920
Hi, Bo.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.433
- Where are my sheep?
- Yeah!

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.794
Look! Woody found me!

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.031
Take the bunny!
I'm too cute to die!

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.839
Hi-ya!
- Oh, no, no!

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.439
Woody!

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.353
- I just wanna talk.
- Yeah, with my voice box!

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.789
Pull!

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.268
Whoa!

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.149
You're my favorite deputy.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.471
Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.136
I'd like to join your posse.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.276
Reach for the sky!

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.193
Girls!

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.634
Drop it.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.032
No! No!
Forky!

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.269
- We've gotta go!
- Wait!

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.593
Forky!

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.280
Woody!

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.835
Bonnie's backpack?

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.155
Ahh!

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.399
Giggle!

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.799
Don't let Woody leave!

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:14.720
Grab on!

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.879
Duke, get us out of here!

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080
Oui!

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.758
Here, kitty, kitty!

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.598
Wait! We don't have Forky!

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.079
Woody!

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.035
Forky!

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.794
Is everyone okay?

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.470
Shh. It's okay.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.193
Shh. It's okay.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.637
Bunny? Bunny?

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.351
Bunny!
No, no, no, no.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.080
No, no, no, no.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.556
- Oh, Bunny!
- It's gonna be okay.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:14.675
Forky's still in there.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.376
If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.719
You want us
to go back in there?

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.994
We barely got out alive.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.388
Woody, it's better if we wait.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.016
No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040
But I saw Bonnie's...

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.216
By my count, there were
only four dummies.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.240
But the backpack...

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.456
We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.799
Woody, look at us!

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.917
Nobody is with you.
It's over, okay?

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.275
No. No, no, no. We are
wasting time. We can do this.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.336
- Come on, Pull-string.
- It's not worth it.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.395
Yeah, yes, listen to her!

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.312
- Nobody wants this!
- I do!

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.515
- Why?
- Because!

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.432
- Why?
- Just because!

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.520
Why?

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.960
Because it's all
I have left to do!

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.398
I don't have anything else.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.438
So, the rest of us
don't count?

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.477
That's not what I meant.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.033
Bonnie needs Forky.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.634
No. You need Bonnie!

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.028
Open your eyes, Woody.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.031
There's plenty of kids
out there.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.239
It can't be just about the one
you're still clinging to.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.237
It's called loyalty.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.271
Something a lost toy
wouldn't understand.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.316
I'm not the one who's lost.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.074
Let's get out of here.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.708
We've got a carnival
that leaves in the morning.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.194
Come on.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.628
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.994
We'll find our own kid.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.513
You're crazy.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.235
Bo!

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.677
Bye, Woody.
Good luck with Bonnie.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.830
Woody, you did all you could.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.672
Time to go home.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.909
No.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Woody.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.479
I don't leave toys behind,
Buzz.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.936
Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving...

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.791
Not now. Not ever.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.431
And he left me behind.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.038
What now, inner voice?

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.080
Mission
accomplished. Return to base.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.315
Go back to the RV?
What about Woody?

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.198
We're going home,
space ranger.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.554
Fall back, this planet...

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.789
Retreat! There's too...

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.791
Go! Time to fly! Exit the...
Back... Run...

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.598
Get out!
Returning to Star Command.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.030
Okay. Okay.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.477
Thanks a lot, inner voice.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.190
Harmony, honey, help Grandma
close up for the night.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.113
Okay. Then can we
go to the carnival?

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.280
Sure.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.038
- Ahhh!
- Hello, Woody.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.755
I knew you'd be back.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.474
You don't know me.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.193
But I do.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.752
You were left in the closet,
feeling useless...

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.391
wondering if you'll
ever get played with.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.357
I'm not leaving without Forky.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.551
Can we agree
on just one thing?

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.469
What?

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.278
That being there for a child

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.670
is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.235
Okay.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.115
I was defective
right out of the box.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.078
I can only imagine what it
must have been like for you.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.672
All that time you spent
with Andy...

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.636
riding a bike with him
for the first time...

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.472
comforting him
when he skinned his knee...

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.876
proudly watching him grow up.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.278
And then you got
a second chance with Bonnie...

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.159
giving her comfort
when she's scared at school...

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.914
helping her
when she needs it most.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.629
You've been there through
all their ups and downs.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.079
Please.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.434
Be honest with me.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.114
Was it as wonderful
as it sounds?

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.433
It was.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.993
All I want is a chance
for just one of those moments.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.229
I'd give anything to be loved
the way you have.

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.679
Just leave me Forky.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.072
Bonnie needs him.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.312
Of course.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.193
The flat tire is fixed!

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.231
Come on, Woody, hurry up.

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.675
Where is he?

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.512
- Buzz!
- Buzz!

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.136
- Where's Woody?
- And Forky?

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.229
We have a situation.

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.136
They need to be extracted
from the antique store.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.520
How do we do that?

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.296
Okay, let's
make sure we have everything.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.992
Finally.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.513
It's okay.
Any minute now...

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.035
Bonnie will notice
her backpack is missing.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.136
She'll realize she left it
at the antique store...

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.479
and we'll head back in there.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.656
Okay.
Looks like we have everything.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.079
- You good, Bonnie?
- Yup.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.736
Great. Let's get out of here.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.711
Okay, genius,
what do we do now?

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.800
Hmm.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.936
Scanning perimeter.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.960
Laser at full power!

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.156
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- I'm thinking.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.016
Honey, will you
please shut that toy off?

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040
Yeah, I got it.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.031
Attack!
Meteor shower! Look out!

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.936
It's a secret mission in
uncharted space! Let's go!

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.235
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.576
Bonnie,
how do you turn this off?

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.720
Full speed ahead!

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.576
- Open the pod bay doors!
- I don't know.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.158
It's just you and me now,
cadet.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.576
A distress signal is coming
from that rocket.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.216
Just toss it in the drawer.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.277
To infinity and beyond!

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.720
Uh-oh. Uh, your backpack's in
the antique store! Let's go!

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.115
Oh, no, my backpack!

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.390
I left my backpack
in the antique store!

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.833
You did?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.912
All right,
let's swing by and get it.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.798
Ugh! I can't believe
the nerve of that cowboy.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.199
I mean,
who does he think he is?

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.599
Exactly!

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.352
He was way out of line.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.200
You did the right thing
leaving him behind.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.073
- Hey, Lamb Chops?
- Hmm.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.872
- Coast is clear.
- Oh.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.360
Head to the middle.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.953
When the carnival
leaves tomorrow,

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.268
we'll hide right there.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.594
- Uh, no way!
- Stuff that.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.680
Awesome.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.074
Stick with me.
You'll be fine.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.296
- Ready?
- No!

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.320
And another thing,

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.976
- Woody asked you for help.
- On your mark...

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.096
And he treats you like that?

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.236
- ...get set...
- He only cares about himself.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.320
No!

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.656
You're wrong.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.440
Woody's always trying to
do right by his kid.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.232
By putting everyone in danger.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.754
Ugh. That kind of crazy
loyalty just...

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.148
You gotta love him for it.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.136
Whoa, say what now?

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.639
Hey, hey, hey, Bo!
What's the plan?

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.914
Fill me in here.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.336
Get in! We're going back.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.360
We just got here.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.272
You heard Bo!
We're going back!

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.510
Move your plush! Let's ride!

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.992
You're my favorite...

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.914
Yay!

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.078
You are my best friend.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.593
Let's play all day!

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.318
Oh, Benson!
Did you hear that?

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.708
Isn't that lovely?

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.949
Time for tea.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.832
Oh, thank you, Woody.
Thank you!

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.599
All my dreams

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.880
are coming true
because of you.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.035
Thank you! Thank you!

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120
Uh, you're welcome.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.316
It's time, Benson.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.588
Goodbye, Forky.
I'm going to miss our talks.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.155
Me, too.
Good luck, Gabby.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.117
Thank you, my little utensil.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.239
Bye, Gabby!
Goodbye, Benson!

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.310
He is terrifying.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.959
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.189
Bonnie?

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.536
Can I help you with anything?

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.816
Yeah. We called
about the backpack.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.637
Oh, yes.
I couldn't find it.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.496
Feel free to look around.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.750
Quick! Before she finds it!

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.311
Look! There's Harmony.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.072
You make me so happy!

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.275
Let's be best friends.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.639
Oh, this is it!

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.558
We're going home, Forky!

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.280
Huh?

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.197
Forky! Oh!

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.429
No, no, no. Woody, look!
It's really happening!

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.274
I'm Gabby Gabby,
and I love you.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.672
I'm gonna cry.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.114
Oh, what have you got there?

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.992
I found this old doll.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.150
You can take it home
if you want.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.989
Nah.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.189
What happened? Gabby was
supposed to be her toy.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.056
There's my backpack!

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.149
Mom, it's over here.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.509
Forky!

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.119
Mom, I found him!

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.713
Oh, there he is!

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.679
Now, please leave him
in there,

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.920
so he doesn't get lost again.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.634
But what about Gabby?

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.918
Forky, listen to me
very carefully.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.718
This is important.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.836
Tell Buzz to get the RV
to the merry-go-round.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.035
You understand?

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.236
Absolutely.
What is a merry-go-round?

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.959
The spinny ride
with lights and horses.

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.400
- Oh. You mean a carousel.
- Yes!

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.718
Carousel. Yes!
Meet me at the carousel.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840
Got it.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.629
Gabby! Hey, Gabby!

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.595
You can have
your voice box back.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.118
I don't need it anymore.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.355
Oh, yes, you do.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.272
Harmony wasn't
your only chance, Gabby,

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.560
but we have to hurry. Come on.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.871
No. Harmony was my chance.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.910
My time's over.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.996
Now, please go away.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.193
You hear that?

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.677
A friend once told me...

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.229
"There are plenty of kids
out there."

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.908
And one of them
is named Bonnie.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.194
She's waiting for you,
right now.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.431
She just doesn't know it yet.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.315
What if you're wrong?

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.096
Well, if you sit on a shelf
the rest of your life...

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.076
you'll never find out,
will you?

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.028
He's right.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.751
I learned that from the best.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.150
Come on, Gabby.

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.958
Let's get you to Bonnie.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:37.720
The carousel?

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.394
Yeah, it's the spinny ride
with lights and horses.

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.198
Woody said to meet him there.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.191
- You gotta be kidding!
- How do we do that?

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.474
Oh! We could, uh...

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:46.834
We are not
sending Dad to jail.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.069
You're no fun.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.800
Left turn in 0.5 miles.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.594
Wait a second. I have an idea.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.920
Skunk!

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Skunk!

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.956
Too many people.
Gonna need an alternate route.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.111
Will we make it
to the carousel in time?

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.196
Yes, we Canada!

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.509
What? What is it?

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.997
Recalculating.
Take a right.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.229
What? A right?

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.118
Right turn ahead.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.096
Huh. Does
the GPS sound funny to you?

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.800
Honey, it's fine. Just drive.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.640
Hmm,
I thought it sounded funny.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.720
Another right!

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:53.916
- Right.
- Take another right.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.513
- Huh?
- Another right? Really?

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.715
- Turn right!
- Now!

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.153
Turn right!

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.096
- We're headin' back.
- There's the carousel!

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.588
Do you think
Woody will get there in time?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.514
Nope. Forget it. Never.
No. No way. Declined.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.560
- No dice. Rejected.
- Duke, Duke, you got this.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.392
This is the fastest way
to the carousel.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.675
You made the last jump.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.831
Yeah, but that was 4 feet.
This is 40!

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.271
Exactly! Duke Caboom
would never repeat a stunt.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.237
- No. He'd never do that.
- No, no, no.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.356
He's the toy
that went on to crash

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.432
40 feet into that target!

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.556
Yeah, he is.

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.239
I'm Duke Caboom!

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.118
Oh, man. I can do this!

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.474
Yes, you Canada!

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.896
I can do it
with my eyes closed.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.920
Yes, you... What?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.840
- Three, two, one. Go!
- What? No, wait!

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.272
- What is he doing?
- Oh, no.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.235
This is for you, Rejean.

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.034
Caboom.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.280
Yes!

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.760
He did it!

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.920
All right, our turn!

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.991
You heard the sheriff.
Let's go.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.120
Yee-haw!

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.233
Another right!

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.032
Another right?
That's the wrong way.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.077
- Are you sure?
- Stupid rental.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.760
- I'm turning us around.
- No!

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.256
- Huh?
- Recalculating.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.349
Turn right.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.829
- Must be broken.
- No! No!

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.360
What is happening?

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.616
Honey, what are you doing?
Slow down!

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640
I can't! I can't!

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.480
- Press the brake. Press it!
- I'm trying.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.319
Got a visual
on the RV,

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.436
heading southbound.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.800
Gabby?

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.360
Gabby?

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.719
I think she's lost.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.633
Are you sure?

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.079
Change of plans.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.958
Pull over.

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.476
I can't! This is a rental!

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.993
I don't know what's happening!

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.033
I'm so nervous.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.676
- What if she doesn't like me?
- Gabby.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.936
I don't know if I can do this.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.428
Gabby,
it's just like you said.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.952
This is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.120
Okay.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.998
Just edge yourself
a bit into the light.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.473
Not too far.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.194
That's it.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.748
Perfect.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.997
- Winner, winner...
- Chicken dinner.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.351
Are you lost, too?

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.475
I'm Gabby Gabby.
Will you be my friend?

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.552
I'll help you.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.035
Excuse me, can you...
Can you help us?

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.593
Oh, honey, what's wrong?

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.478
I can't find my mom and dad.

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.358
It's okay.
I'll help you find them.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.669
I'm sure they're not far.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.216
She was right next to us.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.673
She was right here!

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.336
And I looked
away for one second.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.588
Mommy!

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:39.908
I couldn't find you...

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.274
and then I found this doll.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.440
You did?

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.914
Her name is Gabby Gabby.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.788
Whoa. We actually did that.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.515
Oh, yeah. Yes!

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.398
That was amazing.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.437
We make a great team, guys.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.834
Pull over now!

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.238
Almost there.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.198
- Stop!
- Stop!

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.593
Are we home?

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.439
Huh?

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.748
Sir, will you please
step out of the vehicle?

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.434
Dad's totally going to jail.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.392
Everyone, topside.
Let's move.

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:42.154
Forky, I've got a very
important job for you.

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.959
For me?

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.231
Have a good night.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.676
What the...?

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.756
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400
Hey.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.149
Um... So long, cowboy.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.673
Happy trails.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.755
Billy, Goat, Gruff.
Take care of her, girls.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.795
I'm glad
I got to see you again.

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.039
I... I don't...

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.108
Goodbye, Bo.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.031
Buzz, I... I...

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.593
She'll be okay.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.388
Bonnie will be okay.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.915
You sure?

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.673
Hey.
Listen to your inner voice.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.120
Bo?

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.320
Is it really her?

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.799
I'll be danged,
it's Bo!

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.593
Jessie.

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.269
Bo!

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.431
Oh!

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.359
So long, Forky.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:35.040
Forky?
Who's watching the doors?

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.279
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, boy.

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.915
Oh, my goodness. The awning.
What is going on?

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.356
Does this mean
Woody's a lost toy?

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.675
He's not lost.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.917
Not anymore.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.078
To infinity...

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.990
And beyond.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.148
Yay!

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.075
There goes
another one.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.878
We're never
getting outta here.

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.154
Psst. Frog legs.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.360
Up here, Rainbow Connection.

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:38.034
You Mr. Toads wanna take
a wild ride with a kid?

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.120
We can make that happen.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:40.679
- You can?
- Really?

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.239
Oh, yeah!
Leave it to us, Jeremiah.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.039
Aw.

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.079
All right. Nice job, gang!

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.593
Every prize with a kid.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:30.113
- What's next?
- Leave that to us.

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.120
- We know exactly what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.638
Plush Rush!

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.312
How you like that, huh?

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.198
You got plush-rushed, son!

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.594
Dance!

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.399
Dance! Get those knees up!

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:24.229
Let's see those feet move!
Whoo!

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.915
Or we can get more toys
to kids.

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.752
Yeah, let's do that.

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:44.075
Do you really have laser eyes?

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.080
Yeah.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.549
Whoa.

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.158
Hi, toys. Bye, toys.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.269
Jessie's back!

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.271
What's first grade like?
Tell me everything!

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.440
Well, it was...

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:24.616
How was "Present and Explain"?

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.296
Uh, you mean "Show and Tell"
there, big guy.

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.594
You see any kids eat paste?

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.680
Guys, listen!

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.228
Bonnie had a great day
in first grade.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.635
She even made
a new friend in class.

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.950
Oh, she's already
making friends.

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:38.759
No, no, she made a new friend.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.634
Come on out, it's okay.

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:03.396
Hi. I'm, uh... I'm Forky.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.551
Trash?

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:08.718
No, no. Toy.
I am a...

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.912
We are all toys.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.870
Unique, beautiful toys.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.836
I will explain everything.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.679
How am I alive?

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.230
I don't know.

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:47.798
I was a lonesome cowboy

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.197
Lonesome as I could be

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:57.039
You came along
and changed my life

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.672
And fixed
what was broken in me

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:06.955
I was a lonesome cowboy

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.436
I didn't have a friend

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.679
Now I got friends
coming out of my ears

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.515
I'll never be lonesome again

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.952
You can't be happy
when you're all by yourself

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.350
Go on, tell me I'm wrong

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:28.919
You're wrong

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:33.234
When someone takes you
down from the shelf

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.710
And plays with you some
It's wonderful

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.108
Wonderful

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.751
I was a lonesome cowboy

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.669
But not anymore

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:51.833
I just found out
What love is about

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.276
I've never
felt this way before

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:59.991
I was a lonesome cowboy

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:06.710
But not anymore

01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:56.829
Caboom!

01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.320
Yes!
